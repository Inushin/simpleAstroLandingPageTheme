## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Simple Astro Landing Page project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── img/
│       └── img_00.jpg
│       └── img_01.jpg
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   └── components/
│       └── Footer.astro
│       └── Hero.astro
│       └── Section.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
│       └── global.css
│   └── env.d.ts
├── .gitignore
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tailwind.config.mjs

```

As a simple landing page, we only provide a single page which is going to be rendering the different components: Footer, Hero, and Section.
